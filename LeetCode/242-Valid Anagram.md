# Valid Anagram

## Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an <span data-keyword="anagram">anagram</span> of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"`
>**Output**: `true`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `s = "rat", t = "car"`
>**Output**: `false`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
>
>- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
